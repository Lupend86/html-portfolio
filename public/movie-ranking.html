<h3>Rush Hour 2</h3>

<p>The story line is great, has a good balance of comedy, action and drama scenes</p>

<h3>Bad Boyz 2</h3>

<p>The the story line is similiar in basically all of the movies in this series, the scenes have lines that you can't help but 
   remember and say out loud at random.</p>
